# Real-Time Face Detection using OpenCV and SSD

## üìå Overview

This project demonstrates real-time face detection using OpenCV and a pre-trained SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector) model. It captures video from a camera, detects faces, and displays the results with bounding boxes and confidence scores.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

**This project is intended for educational purposes only. The author is not responsible for any misuse.**

## üöÄ Features

- Real-time face detection using a pre-trained SSD model.
- Displays bounding boxes and confidence scores for detected faces.
- Automatic download and extraction of required assets (if not already present).

## üìÇ Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- `requests` library for downloading assets

## üîß Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/konynour/faceDectection.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the Project Folder
```sh
cd face-detection
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```sh
pip install opencv-python requests
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

### Downloading Assets

The script will automatically download and extract the required assets if they are not found in the current directory. These assets include a pre-trained SSD model and its configuration file.

### Running the Script

To run the face detection script, execute the following command:

```sh
python 1.py
```

This will open a window displaying the camera feed with detected faces highlighted by bounding boxes and confidence scores. 

- Press **ESC** to exit the application.

### Command-Line Arguments

You can specify the camera source as a command-line argument. For example:

```sh
python 1.py 1
```

This will use the second camera (index 1) instead of the default camera (index 0).
